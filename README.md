- 👋 Hi, I’m @madelinePrickette
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, bird species, fish, and more wildlife like amphibians, politics, candles, tea and books!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Prime Digital Academy where I am going to graduate in July of 2022, and hopefully begin a career and continue my education.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a dry run project to create easier-to-navigate voter registration websites to allow more folks to access our nations voting system.
