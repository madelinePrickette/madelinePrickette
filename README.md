- Greetings fellow traveler, I’m Madeline Prickette.
- I’m interested in video games, primarily Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege, Capcom's Resident Evil series, and Mojang's Minecraft. In addition, I like Rust.
- I’m currently a full stack web developer at Prime Digital Academy looking for employment within the east coast, or anywhere! Overseas too.
- I’m looking forward to become a game developer and work on independent projects for fun.
- Feel free to find me on LinkedIn to connect.
